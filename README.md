# Time-Sand-Hopper
A small game that I made with Unity and C++

Out of curiosity, during my highschool years, I decided to create a 
game. I used Unity and programmed it with C++ which I had to learn 
for the purpose of my tiny project. After creating a couple levels 
I was happy with what I made since it was intended as a test project 
to serve as my first introduction to programming.

You can jump, and double jump, by pressing space.
You can move with the A and D keys.
The goal of the game is to get to the teleport point.
If the point doesn't move you to the next level when you touch
 it, then you need to gather all the fragments then touch it again.
